For this IMF balance of payments data, I took several steps to clean the data and will need to talk further steps I was not
able to figure out. First, I recognized all the elipses in the data represented data the IMF was unable to verify. Therefore, 
I wanted to replace all elipses with zeros to keep the data consistent. I used find and replace to achieve this. Next, I had to 
remove all the "Ks" from the spreadsheet that represented putting the given figures in thousands. I was able to delete the "Ks" 
through find and replace, but was unable to figure out how to convert all the figures with "Ks" into their proper amount. This 
next step is all I would need to do to finish cleaning this otherwise well-done data sheet.
