While historically pro-Western institutions like the International Monetary Fund have extended loans to Latin American countries, 
Chinese-government banks have stepped up in recent years and filled the void, creating a new nexus of debt obligations across the region. 
Due to China's "Belt & Road" initiative, many policymakers have focused on China's debt-based relationships with Asian and African nations,
but Latin America's place in Beijing's financial network has grown in a region traditionally controlled by the United States. For this project, 
I will compare Chinese government loans to recent loans made by the IMF. I will use watchdogs which track Chinese government loans like the 
Inter-American Dialogue for one side of the data, and plan to use IMF reports for it's side of the data. For sources, I will contact the team at 
the IAD that tracks this data, as well as former officials for IMF, World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. The Washington Office on 
Latin America is another excellent resource that I've utilized in the past. I believe that while this data will show China has far greater financial 
influence in the region, the IMF is re-emerging as a player. In recent memory, the IMF was kicked out by many left-wing governments in Latin 
America for it's decades-long role in destabilizing the region's economies. But now that most of these governments are no longer in power, the 
IMF has returned to the region with full force, most notably with it's recording setting $57 billion loan deal with Argentina.
