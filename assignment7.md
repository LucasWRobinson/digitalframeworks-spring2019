1. The three largest U.S. weapons manufacturers have already donated $44,500 to Indiana members of Congress in 2019, 
targeting their donations largely based on committee assignments. 

2. Examining donations by Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to Indiana lawmakers show that donations by large 
weapons manufacturers remains strategic even for a small state like Indiana. The largest recepient is Peter Visclosky, the 
new Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Defense, which controls all U.S. funding for the military. 
Visclosky, a longstanding recepient of arms industry cash, raised $17,000 from the top three weapons companies in the
first four months of 2019. 

3. I first downloaded all 2019 campaign finance disclosures for the PACs of Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon. Then I sorted 
Indiana lawmakers from all the recepients in each spreadsheet. I then added the sum of contributions for each lawmaker 
for each spreadsheet. To look for possible explainations and patterns, I looked up committee assignments for each lawmaker 
as well as offices or manufacturing facilities for each company. 

4. HEADLINE - As Defense Appropriations Chairman, Visclosky Rakes in Campaign Cash from Top Arms Manufacturers

Nut Graf: Indiana Democrat Rep. Visclosky, the new Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Defense, 
has already raised $17,000 from the top three weapons companies, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, in his first four months 
as head of the subcommittee. As a longtime member of the powerful subcommittee which controls all U.S. government defense 
spending in the House, Visclosky has taken $1.5 million from the arms and aerospace industry since 1998. Visclosky was 
investigated by the House Ethics Committee along with other members of the committee in 2009 for steering congressional 
earmarks toward campaign contributors. He was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. 

Next Steps: Check the rest of the FEC disclosures for the three companies to see where Visclosky ranks among other 
lawmakers.
