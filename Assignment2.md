While U.S. officials and Latin American experts are justly concerned about China's growing financial influence in Latin America, little attention is given to how Western, US-supported financial institutions are increasing debt-diplomacy in the region. Furthermore, as the West and China battle for sway in the region, the net effect on Latin American governments is greater indebtedness to both sides in general. In this story, I want to explore the origins, causes and consequences of debt politics in Latin America. Most importantly, I want to learn how greater fealty to China and the West is affecting the lives of regular Latin Americans, who suffer the brunt of thinning national budgets as greater resources go toward servicing debt. 

To gather this data, I have been using news reports, the Inter-American Dialogue's Chinese finance tracker, and press releases from relevant financial institutions.
