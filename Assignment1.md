*Story Ideas* 
1. IMF v. Chinese Loans in Latin America
There is an ongoing battle for influence in Latin America between the United States and China. Much of that battle is 
played out in the extension of loans to Latin American nations. Since 2005, China has extended $141 billion in loans to 
Latin American for energy and infrastructure projects. Latin America has a long history of being taken advantage of through 
international loans, and many blame past loans by the International Monetary Fund for exacerbating austerity-induced poverty 
in the region. Despite widespread mistrust, the International Monetary Fund is again extending loans to Latin America as 
some nations balance between Western and Chinese influence. In the past year, the IMF has reached loan agreements 
with Ecuador, Haiti and Argentina. The $57 billion deal made with Argentina is the largest in the IMF’s history. I think a 
breakdown of international loan politics in Latin America could be an exciting visual story that shows a case study for 
how China and U.S.-friendly financial institutions battle for influence around the world. I would like to learn from this 
story what faction has more financial influence in Latin American and what that means for the future of the region. 

2. Plan Colombia and Immigration
Last year I calculated what appears to be a correlation between the US-Colombia aid program known as Plan Colombia 
and Colombians immigrating to the United States. Despite being in a continuing state of war for decades, Colombian 
immigration to the United States does not rise until 1999, the advent of increased U.S. aid to Colombia military 
and paramilitary forces, who have since been implicated in myriad human rights abuses. The number of Colombia 
internally displaced also rises over the same period. While this correlation might be easily explained by the 
general displacement caused by Colombia anti-narcotics military campaign, the role of U.S. aid in this phenomena 
cannot be understated. From this assignment, I would like to know if it’s possible US assistance to the Colombian military 
caused increases in internal and external migration in Colombia, and if there are other examples of this happening elsewhere 
in the world. 

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

Link (https://www.thedialogue.org/map_list/)

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 
   * What was it?
   * Was it in the headline?
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. 
   * Did they provide a source?
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks?
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together?
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)
   * Explain
*Color (1-5)
   * Explain
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * How?
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.
