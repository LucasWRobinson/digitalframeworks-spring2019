*Story Ideas* 
1. IMF v. Chinese Loans in Latin America
There is an ongoing battle for influence in Latin America between the United States and China. Much of that battle is 
played out in the extension of loans to Latin American nations. Since 2005, China has extended $141 billion in loans to 
Latin American for energy and infrastructure projects. Latin America has a long history of being taken advantage of through 
international loans, and many blame past loans by the International Monetary Fund for exacerbating austerity-induced poverty 
in the region. Despite widespread mistrust, the International Monetary Fund is again extending loans to Latin America as 
some nations balance between Western and Chinese influence. In the past year, the IMF has reached loan agreements 
with Ecuador, Haiti and Argentina. The $57 billion deal made with Argentina is the largest in the IMF’s history. I think a 
breakdown of international loan politics in Latin America could be an exciting visual story that shows a case study for 
how China and U.S.-friendly financial institutions battle for influence around the world. I would like to learn from this 
story what faction has more financial influence in Latin American and what that means for the future of the region. 

2. Plan Colombia and Immigration
Last year I calculated what appears to be a correlation between the US-Colombia aid program known as Plan Colombia 
and Colombians immigrating to the United States. Despite being in a continuing state of war for decades, Colombian 
immigration to the United States does not rise until 1999, the advent of increased U.S. aid to Colombia military 
and paramilitary forces, who have since been implicated in myriad human rights abuses. The number of Colombia 
internally displaced also rises over the same period. While this correlation might be easily explained by the 
general displacement caused by Colombia anti-narcotics military campaign, the role of U.S. aid in this phenomena 
cannot be understated. From this assignment, I would like to know if it’s possible US assistance to the Colombian military 
caused increases in internal and external migration in Colombia, and if there are other examples of this happening elsewhere 
in the world. 

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. - 5
   * What was it? - Levels of Chinese government loans to different countries in Latin America 
   * Was it in the headline? - Yes
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent - 5
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? - To me, the design of being able to hover over a different country and immediately be able to see a graph of loans over time is the best possible experience for the data. 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? - I didn’t initial realize how the two windows on the site can be used together, allowing the reader to see the breakdown of the loans on the map as well as the columns. This feature wasn’t immediately obvious, so perhaps the option for a brief walkthrough would be best. 
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. - I have no reason to question the authenticity of this data. 
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. - Announcement by Chinese government banks or Latin American finance ministries. 
   * Did they provide a source? - No specific source for the data is listed. 
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? - I would have liked to see a methodology for how they collected this data. 

### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) - 5
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. - The graphic is extremely intuitive and easy to navigate.
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks? - Yes, it is organized around the borders of different Latin American nations, something the average user of this data would be well acquainted. 
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together?
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5) 5
   * Explain - As with the color, the font matches well with the website's overall design and doesn't distract the reader. 
*Color (1-5) 4
   * Explain - The use of the soothing blue color makes the graphic appear naturally on the screen and does not distract the reader from the interactive data. 
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * How? - The most creative part of the design is the merging of the two different axis of organization, the map/column and the breakdown of the loans. 
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. - 4

   * What was it? - US support of questionable elements of the Colombian government through the aid program Plan Colombia.  
   * Was it in the headline? - Kind of
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent - 5
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? - Yes, the bar graph farther down the article is very easy to understand. 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? - I'd have liked to see the bar graph farther up in the story, also other data would have been nice to see.  
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate - 5
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. - I have no reason to question the authenticity of this data. 
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. - Presidential announcement for aid suspensions, as well as Colombia's own funding for its military and paramilitaries. 
   * Did they provide a source? - Yes 
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? - For the purposes of the author, yes

### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) - 4
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. - The graphic was not very flashy, so maybe having movement in the graphic instead of just a static bar chat could make the conveying of the data more exciting. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks? - The graphic only provides the reader with a data for a small element of the larger story, i.e. the disproptionate use of military opposed to economic aid.  
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish - The graphic failed to drive home the importance of the disportionate use of military aid by being incorrectly organized near the bottom of the article. 

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it:

* Type (1-5) 4
   * Explain - The font fits well with the Washington Post's overall design. 
*Color (1-5) 5
   * Explain - By using different colors in the bars, it makes it easier for the reader to understand the central message of the graphic - the disproportioante use of military aid. 
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
