Headline: World Bank development loans to Latin America remain at record-setting levels

Lede: Development loans extended to Latin America by the World Bank hit their second-highest level in history in 2017, beat out only by 2016, according to World Bank data. 

Nut Graf: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans totaled $50.5 billion in 2017, the most recent for data, dropping only 1.6 percent from the previous year. Most IBRD loans are disportionately used by Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, who account for 81 percent of all loans. The slight reduction in the total between the two years is attributable to a decrease in the money owed by Peru and Guatemala.
